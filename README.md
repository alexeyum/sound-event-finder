# Sound Event Finder

A mobile app that finds various sounds with timecodes in an audio file using AI. 
It can detect sounds from over 500 classes, including vehicle sounds (e.g. car engine,
train horn, helicopter), animal sounds (e.g. dog bark, pig oink, crow caw), 
human sounds (e.g. speech, clapping, baby crying), and many more. The app assigns time
intervals for each sound event, and allow overlapping intervals for different events.
